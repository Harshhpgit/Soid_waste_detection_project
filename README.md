Introduction

Waste management is a critical challenge in today’s world, especially as urban populations grow and consumption increases. Every day, tons of solid waste are generated, and without proper segregation, much of it ends up in landfills—polluting the environment and wasting valuable recyclable resources. The process of manually sorting waste is time-consuming, unhygienic, and prone to error. This often leads to improper disposal, which can harm ecosystems and public health. With advancements in technology—particularly computer vision and deep learning—we now have the opportunity to automate and improve this process. This project, SolidWasteClassification, aims to recognize and categorize different types of waste, such as plastic, glass, metal, paper, biodegradable, and cardboard materials. The goal is to promote cleaner cities and smarter waste management by making segregation more efficient, accurate, and scalable.
